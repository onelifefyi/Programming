1: 29/04/2020: Refreshed about variables and Strings basics.
2: 02/05/2020: In a python list we use append if we just want to add an element at end
               and extend if we want to add each elements of other list.
3: 06/05/2020: -Dictionaries and it's functions
	       -Tuples
	       -Sets
	       -Boolean
4: 10/05/2020: Input-Output, iterables tuple unpacking
	      - for and while loops; continue, break and pass(new one: it's just a statement that does nothing, mainly used b'cos
		python doesn't allow blank intended statement)
5: 11/05/2020: range(), random(shuffle and randint) enumerate() to generate tuple from iterable w/ index and zip(to combine two list as tuple)
	       - input()
		- Those slickkk one liners, It's called LIST-COMPREHENSION
		- Python methods and functions with comments and all
6: 12/05/2020: *args and **kwargs (tuple, dictionary arguments resp)
		- lambda functions, map(iterate function call for each input) and filter(iterate function and return the input for which o/p == True)
		- Scope(LEGB: Local, Enclosing function local, Global, Built-in)
		- Project: tic-tac-toe: took a lot of reference (mainly took the steps and implemented it)
7: 13/05/2020: - OOP, class and __init__, need of passing self(kinda like this but required)
		- Class object attribute and methods
		- Inheritance class className(inherited_class_name) and polymorphism(not so cool)
8: 14/05/2020: - OOP: special functions __del__() __str__() and __len__() for deletion message, print() o/p and len() output resp
		- small bank class challange
		- modules (Just normal python scripts)
		- package (collection of modules in a folder with one special __init__.py (to identify folder as package))
		- if __name__ == '__main__'
		- Note: Module is completely run if imported (So, all level zero i.e, non indendet code will be executed if imported)
